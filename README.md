# Project-Decoder-Ring-1
Encoder/decoder project used to take in a message and encode it using optional methods.
User is also able to input their previously coded message and return a decoded version of that message.
Built in VS Code with JavaScript and HTML
I had a lot of fun building this project and I see some potential in it.
I have plans to create an interactive web applicate with this code using React.js, React Router, and styling it with SASS, potentially deploying the finished project.
