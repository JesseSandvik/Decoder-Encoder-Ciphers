## Overview
This is a word/phrase encoder/decoder tool. This is a simple way to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Installation
Fork & clone the repository. |
---------------------------- |
cd Decoder-Encoder-Ciphers   |
navigate to index.html       |
run on live server           |

## Usage
The Caesar Cipher will shift the letters of each word a given number of spaces and return the result of the encryption/decryption. The number of spaces to shift will be input by the user.

The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. The result will be the given coordinates of each letter that is provided by the user.

The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.

## Build Notes
This application was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS for styling, & Mocha/Chai for testing.

## Contributions
This application was originally built as part of the curriculum from my time in the full-stack engineering program at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/).
